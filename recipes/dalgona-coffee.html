        <h2>What the heck is it?!</h2>
            <p>
                Dalgona coffee is a beverage made by whipping equal parts instant coffee powder, sugar, and hot water until it becomes creamy and then adding it to cold or hot milk.
            </p>
            <p>
                Occasionally, it is topped with coffee powder, cocoa, crumbled biscuits, or honey.
