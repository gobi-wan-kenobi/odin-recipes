<h2>What the heck is it?!</h2>
    <p>
        Dalgona coffee is a beverage made by whipping equal parts instant coffee powder, sugar, and hot water until it becomes creamy and then adding it to cold or hot milk.

        Occasionally, it is topped with coffee powder, cocoa, crumbled biscuits, or honey.

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the instant coffee, sugar, and hot water to a small bowl. (I just use hot water from the faucet)</li>

        <li>Fill a glass with a good amount of ice, and milk. (Use more or less milk depending on how strong you want the drink)</li>
